Documentation (short report or slide): Show your approach to implement this tool (technology stack, workflow, etc.), how you observe the result generated by LLM, limitations of this tool and the improvements in the future.

1. Text-based PDFs (digitally generated) + Scanned PDFs (images requiring OCR) Note You may use any OCR tool of your choice, such as Tesseract.
    - Multiple format handling: CONVERT FROM UNSTRUCTURE DATA INTO STRUCTURE DATA SECTION 2-3

2. Define and implement a systematic evaluation method for your tool
    - Entity Extraction: BUILD LLM PROMTP ASSOCIATED WITH METADATA AND RESPONSE TO EXTRACT 
    - Result validation: EXTRACT GROUND TRUTH FROM CSV FILE HTML (REGEX) -> EVALUATE LLM PERFORMANCE WITH IT USING ACCURACY PER TERMS + Advanced SELF EVALUATION LLM

Workflow PNG files attachments

Limitation: 
+ Time to explore componments of html in ground truth 
+ Token to call open api to test different promp templates
